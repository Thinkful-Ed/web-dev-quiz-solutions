## Testing: Test-driven development

1.  Assume you are about to write a function called `getTopScorerName()` with the following functionality.

    ```javascript
    const students = [
      { name: "Ray Morales", score: 10.0 },
      { name: "Li Harvey", score: 9.8 },
      { name: "Ellie King", score: 8.4 },
    ];

    getTopScorerName(students); //> "Ray Morales"
    getTopScorerName([]); //> null
    ```

    Select all of the following possible cases you _could_ test.

    **Answer:** All of the above

2. Assume you are about to write tests for the `getTopScorerName()` function.

    Which of the following tests would be the _first_ you might write if you were following a test-driven development process?
