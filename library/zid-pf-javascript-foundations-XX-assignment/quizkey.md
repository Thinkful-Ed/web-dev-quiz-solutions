1. Mentally evaluate the following code. What will be printed to the console?

    ```js
    function shortTitle(title) {
      if (!title.includes(":")) return title;

      let result = "";
      for (let i = 0; i < title.length; i++) {
        const character = title[i];
        if (character !== ":") {
          result += character;
        } else {
          break;
        }
      }

      return result;
    }

    const title = "Bad Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch";
    const shortened = shortTitle(title);
    console.log(shortened);
    ```

    **Answer:** C. "Bad Omens"

2. Select all of the following statements that are true about the above question.

    **Answers:** B and D.

    The `break` keyword stops the `for` loop from continuing any further.

    Instead of `const character = title[i]`, the function would work properly if `let character = title[i]` was used.

3. Mentally evaluate the following code. What will be printed to the console?

    ```js
    const authors = [
      {
        name: { first: "Neil", surname: "Gaiman" },
        knighted: false,
      },
    ];
    const author = {
      name: {
        first: "Terry",
        surname: "Pratchett",
      },
    };

    authors.push(author);
    const result = [ authors, author ];
    author.knighted = true;
    console.log(result);
    ```

    **Answer:** D.

    ```js
    [
      [
        {
          name: { first: "Neil", surname: "Gaiman" },
          knighted: false,
        },

      },
    ];
    ```

4. Select all of the following statements that are true about the above question.

    **Answers:** A and D.

    Placing the `authors` array into a new array will lead to an array inside of an array.

    The same object that represents author is inside of the `authors` array and the `result` array.
