## Collaboration with GitHub: Feature branch workflow

1. Imagine you are attempting to follow the feature branch workflow and have completed the following steps:
        
    1. On the `main` branch, you ran `git pull` so you have the most up-to-date version.
        
    1. You created a new feature branch from the `main` branch.

    What's the next step?

    **Answer:** B. Create commits on your new branch.

2. For what reason would you need to change your repository's permissions?

    **Answer:** C. To allow for other users to push code to your repository.

3. Once you've pushed a branch to GitHub, a banner should show on the matching repository that allows you to create a pull request.

    If that banner somehow doesn't show, how else could you create a pull request?

    **Answer:** D. Visit the **Pull requests** tab and select the **New pull request** button.
