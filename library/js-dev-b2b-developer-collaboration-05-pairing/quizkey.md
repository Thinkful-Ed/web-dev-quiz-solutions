**Developer collaboration: Pairing**

1. What is pair programming?

A. Pair programming is the practice of working on multiple problems with a peer, in separate workspaces, to maximize productivity.
B. Pair programming is the practice of working on multiple problems with at least two other peers, in one Github repository.
C. Pair programming is the practice of working on a single problem with a peer, in one shared workspace.
D. Pair programming is the practice of working on multiple problems with at least two other peers, in separate Github repositories.

**Answer: C**

2. Which of the following is a potential benefit of pair programming?

A. Improved resiliency to interruption or distraction
B. Increased code quality
C. Skills transfer from a senior to junior developer
D. All of the above

**Answer: D**

3. Which of the following statement is true? Pick one.

A. In pair programming, two developers work on the same feature on the same shared screen; when one developer gets tired, the other developer takes over so the original developer can take a break. This helps improve productivity.
B. In pair programming, there are two distinct roles: the *driver* and the *navigator*. The driver and navigator implement the code in separate workspaces at the same time. 
C. In pair programming, there are two distinct roles: the *driver* and the *navigator*. The navigator implements the code, while the driver is responsible for keeping the larger picture in mind and guiding the driver in the right direction. 
D. In pair programming, there are two distinct roles: the *driver* and the *navigator*. The driver implements the code, while the navigator is responsible for keeping the larger picture in mind and guiding the driver in the right direction. 

**Answer: D**

4. Which best practices should you follow during a pair programming session? Select all that applies.

A. At the start of a pairing session, determine who will be the driver and who will be the navigator. Clearly define a point when you will switch roles.
B. Make sure to communicate your thoughts if you feel that the pairing isn't working effectively, or if you're struggling to work together effectively for any significant reason.
C. In order to save time, the more experienced developer, regardless of whether that person is the driver or navigator, should take over and start implementing code whenever the other developer is struggling.
D. All of the above.

**Answer: A, B**
