**DSA Introduction: What are algorithms**


1. Select all that are true for computational problems.

**Answer: A. Problems must be well-specified**

**Answer: B.  The inputs to the problem must be specified**

**Answer: D. The outputs of the problem must be specified**

**Answer: E. The relationship between the inputs and the outputs must be specified**

2. Select all that are true about **algorithms**

**Answer: A. An algorithm is a solution to a computational problem**

**Answer: B. There may be more than one algorithms that solve the same problem**

**Answer: E. An algorithm is made up of a finite number of steps. It must stop with a correct output eventually.**

3. Consider the following problem:

Given two integers a and b as inputs, return the value of a devided by b. If b = 0 return "Cannot divide by zero".

The following algorithm purports to solve this problem.

**Answer: A. Correctness - The output produced by the algorithm is correct for all valid input**

4. The number of steps that are needed to execute an algorithm for a given input is called the...

**Answer: B. Time complexity**
