**DSA Introduction: Why study algorithms**


1. Which of these two options will result in faster processing time?

**Answer: A.Implement the new algorithm that requires n instructions to process n records**

2. If the company decided to buy a computer that was 10 times as fast as the current computer, how long will it take to process the 10 million records?

**Answer: C. About 6 minutes**

3. If the company decided to implement the new algorithm and keep the same computer, how long will it take to process 10 million records?

**Answer: A.Less than a second**

4. The company has since grown and now has 20 million (20,000,000) records to process.

If the original algorithm that takes n^2 instructions to process n records was used on the original computer that performs 30 billion (30,000,000,000) instructions per second, how long will it take to process the data now?

**Answer: B.About 4 hours**

5. The company has since grown and now has 20 million (20,000,000) records to process.

If the original algorithm that takes n^2 instructions to process n records was used on the new computer that performs 300 billion (300,000,000,000) instructions per second, how long will it take to process the data now?

**Answer: A. Faster than one hour**
