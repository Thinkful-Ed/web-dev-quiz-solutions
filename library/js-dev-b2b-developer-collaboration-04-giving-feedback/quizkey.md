**Developer collaboration: Giving feedback**

1. How would you improve the feedback below?

"This code should not call the `submitTransactions()` method."

A. "Please do not use the `submitTransactions()` method."
B. "You should not use the `submitTransactions()` method. Nobody should use it anymore."
C. "Why are you still using the `submitTransactions()` method? Didn't you know it'd be deprecated soon? Let me know if you can't find the docs for the new method."
D. "This code should not call the `submitTransactions()` method, because it is based on a third-party library that will be deprecated soon. Instead, the code should use `submitTransactionsSafe()`, which is documented here."

**Answer: D**

2. How would you improve the feedback below?

"You should never, ever use semi-colons to terminate expressions in JavaScript. It is unnecessary and unsightly. Remove them."

A. "I'm a senior engineer with many years of experience and I don't like semi-colons so let's not use them." 
B. "As a team, we've decided it's important for our code formatting and styles to be consistent. Therefore, we've decided omit semi-colons unless they are needed for the code to run. What do you think?"
C. "Semi-colons are obviously not needed in many parts of the codebase, so let's not waste time using them."
D. None of the above.

**Answer: B**

3. How would you improve the feedback below?

"This function does not work."

A. "This function could be better."
B. "This function does not work because it does not explicitly return an output. To fix the code, try adding `return result;` at the end of the function body."
C. "You should be able to easily fix this function if you take a look at the documentation referenced here."
D. "Can you _please_ run this function again locally to make sure it works before submitting a pull request?"

**Answer: B**
