## DSA introduction: An efficiency example

1. Carefully study the output from the tests and compare it to the graph. There are two functions plotted on this graph, one depicted with a blue line and one depicted with a red line.

    Which algorithm is most likely represented by each of the lines?

    **Answer:** A. The blue line represents algorithm 1, and the red represents algorithm 2.

2. Which algorithm is most likely the more efficient missing number algorithm?

    **Answer:** B. Algorithm 2

3. Looking at the red line on the graph, which statement most likely describes the growth rate of the algorithm that it represents?

    **Answer:** C. It has a linear growth rate.

4.  The cable problem: Which algorithm is most likely represented by each of the lines?

    **Answer:** B. The blue line represents algorithm 2 and the red line represents algorithm 1.

5. Which algorithm is most likely the more efficient cable algorithm?

    **Answer:** B. Algorithm 2.

6. Looking at the red line on the graph, which statement most likely describes the growth rate of the algorithm that it represents?

    **Answer:** C. It has a linear growth rate.

7. Looking at the blue line on the graph, which statement most likely describes the growth rate of the algorithm that it represents?

    **Answer:** A. It has a constant growth rate.
