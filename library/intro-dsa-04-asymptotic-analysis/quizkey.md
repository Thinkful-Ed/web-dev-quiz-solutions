1. What is the growth rate of the function shown in the graph?

    **Answer:** A. `O(n)`

2. With this function, how many steps does it take to execute `reverse("Hello World!")`?

    **Answer:** C. 40

3. What is the order of growth with an algorithm?

    **Answer:** C. The rate at which the running time of an algorithm increases as a function of the input size.

4. For an algorithm with running time `4n+8`, what is the rate of change?

    **Answer:** C. `n`

5. What is the average runtime for the following algorithm?

    **Answer:** A. `n/2`
