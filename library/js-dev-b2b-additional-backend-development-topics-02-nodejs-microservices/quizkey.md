## Advanced backend development topics: Node.js microservices

1. Select the statement that is TRUE about a monolithic architecture.

A. It separates the functionality of an application into independent units.
B. It centralizes all the functionality of an application into one large unit.
C. It allows companies to have smaller and more autonomous development teams.
D. It allows every feature to be independently deployable.

**Answer: B**

2. Which of the following statements is/are TRUE about a microservices architecture? Select all that apply.

A. It centralizes all the functionality of an application into one large unit.
B. It makes it easier to onboard new developers since they only have to focus on the service they're working on rather than the entire application.
C. Node.js is not a suitable choice for building microservices because it uses JavaScript, which does not have the performance needed to support microservices.
D. It separates the functionality of an application into independent units or services.

**Answer: B, D**

3. True/False. Microservices can communicate with each other via HTTP API calls.

A. True
B. False

**Answer: True**

4. Which of the following is/are potential drawback(s) of using a microservice architecture? Select all that apply.

A. Developers can select and integrate only the services their application needs to be functional.
B. Every service can be deployed independently of other services.
C. Too many services could lead to substantial time and effort in configuring and integrating the services.
D. Allowing services and applications to "discover" each other on a network can be a complex problem.

**Answer:C & D**

5. True/False. In a microservices architecture, if a developer updates a single service and that update contains a bug, then other services in the system would likely also go down, causing the entire application to crash.

A. True
B. False

**Answer: B**

6. What is scalability?

A. It refers to the ability to scale server resources up or down based on traffic demands.
B. It refers to the ability of a system to recover from failures.
C. It refers to the ability of developers to write clean and performant code in a given codebase.
D. It refers to the assembly and integration of microservices into a functional application.

**Answer: A**

7. True/False. Node.js is particularly suitable for building microservices because it handles requests one at a time, thereby lessening the risks of request handling errors.

A. True
B. False

**Answer: B**
